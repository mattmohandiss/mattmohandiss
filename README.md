## About Me

I build reliable backend systems and automated evaluation platforms for complex software.

Previously worked in cloud infrastructure and multi-tenant Kubernetes environments, focusing on correctness, regression detection, and operational reliability.  

Currently pursuing an MS in Computer Science at the University of Copenhagen with interests in:

- Human–computer interaction  
- Evaluation of human–AI systems  
- Constraint-based feedback systems  
- ML evaluation and anomaly detection

## 🔬 Selected Work

### Evaluation Frameworks
Designed and integrated automated evaluation systems into CI/CD pipelines to detect regressions and compare system behavior across releases.

### Cloud Platform Engineering
Operated and scaled Kubernetes-based infrastructure in Azure, emphasizing observability, reliability, and secure multi-tenant architecture.

### Manufacturability Feedback (DFM Tool — Early Stage)
Exploring constraint-based geometric analysis for CAD models using OpenCascade to provide automated manufacturability feedback.

### Anomaly Detection Systems
Built LSTM-based time-series anomaly detection pipelines with calibrated evaluation of false positives and thresholds.
