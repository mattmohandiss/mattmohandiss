				<h3>
					<span class="role">DevOps Engineer — SAS</span>
					<span class="dates">Jun 2022 – Aug 2025</span>
				</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>
						Owned the migration from on-prem infrastructure to Microsoft Azure using infrastructure-as-code
						(Terraform, Helm), reducing deployment times by 70% and enabling rapid iteration across teams.
					</li>
					<li>
						Built and operated Kubernetes-based, multi-tenant platforms supporting 500,000+ users, maintaining
						99.999% uptime through robust observability, alerting, and on-call incident response.
					</li>
					<li>
						Designed and implemented automated evaluation frameworks integrated into CI/CD pipelines,
						enabling fast detection of regressions, systematic comparison of system behavior across releases,
						and higher-confidence deployments.
					</li>
					<li>
						Developed schema-driven test and evaluation systems that allowed engineers to easily add new
						scenarios, run evals locally or in CI, and drill into failures affecting real user workflows.
					</li>
					<li>
						Owned data pipelines backed by PostgreSQL, message queues, and Elasticsearch for 14 clients,
						doubling ingestion throughput while improving correctness guarantees and operational reliability.
					</li>
					<li>
						Designed secure cloud environments using RBAC, IAM, and Azure Key Vault, implementing NIST SP 800-53
						controls for public-sector clients.
